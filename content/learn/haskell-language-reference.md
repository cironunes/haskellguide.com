# applicatives
- monads were added before applicative
- applicative is a superclass of monad
- inspired by a paper - http://strictlypositive.org/Idiom.pdf
- applicative has a bunch of laws (in category theory)
- if something implements applicative it should follow these laws
- it is possible to implement without the laws but it isn't a valid instance
- none of the laws are checked by the type system but we can check them with tests (ie property tests)

# datatype

# functor
Representation of the mathematical functor: a mapping between categories in the context of category theory.

# fold
A fold deals with two things: a combining function, and a data structure, typically a list of elements. The fold then proceeds to combine elements of the data structure using the function in some systematic way.

# hask
In terms of category theory, Hask is the category of Haskell types and functions. The objects of Hask are Haskell types.

# type

# string
String has exactly one use, and thatâ€™s showing Hello World in tutorials. For all other uses, Text is what people should be using.

# newtype
- cannot be a sumtype
- needs to have a constructor which can only take in a singular argument
