# applicatives
- monads were added before applicative
- applicative is a superclass of monad
- inspired by a paper - http://strictlypositive.org/Idiom.pdf
- applicative has a bunch of laws (in category theory)
- if something implements applicative it should follow these laws
- it is possible to implement without the laws but it isn't a valid instance
- none of the laws are checked by the type system but we can check them with tests (ie property tests)

# string
String has exactly one use, and thatâ€™s showing Hello World in tutorials. For all other uses, Text is what people should be using.
